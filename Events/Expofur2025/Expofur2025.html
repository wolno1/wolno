        <h1>My Experience at ExpoFur 2025!</h1>

        <p>So, I was at the ExpoFur 2025! At first, I didn't even know about the event until a friend sent me the link to the Facebook page. He told me we should go! I checked the prices and I figured owning a table wasn't that expensive!</p>

                <p>It felt awesome to look at all this pile of comics!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-text">
                <p>Of course, I had never been an exhibitor at a con before, so I had literally no merch. I had to think of what I could do. I sent examples of a couple drawings I could use for stickers, also said I could do buttons and the best part... I could sell the comic!</p>
                <p>By the moment I submitted my request (November 29) for the con, I hadn't even started to draw it! I started until the first days of December! So there you have me, organizing everything, looking for suppliers for stickers, buttons, and places to print my comic.</p>

        <p>I didn't have too much to decorate it to be fair...</p>
        <p>Stickers and comics were easy! I just printed them at a local printing house, but the buttons... I was a bit lost on where to get them! Luckily for me, I shared a table with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunnahowell/">Lunna Howell</a>, who was really kind and it was really nice to share a table with her. She told me where I could get buttons for a good price!</p>

        <p>My buttons had a little glitter effect... I loved them! Fun fact: Inu (the right one) was the most popular one!</p>

        <p>At the con, I couldn't have been happier. It was a place where I could be myself! I met some great people, great friends! I sold <strong>almost</strong> what I was aiming for, but that <em>almost</em> is so small I don't count it! This means this is not the only con I will be attending!</p>

        <p>Can you guess who this is? A quick doodle of Inu!</p>
        <p>I grabbed a comic I thought looked a bit too odd to sell and decided to draw and chew on him when I got bored.</p>

            <p>This beautiful piece was made by <a href="https://x.com/sketchesJang">Dreamknight JANG</a>. Sadly, it got stolen a day after the con, but luckily I scanned it a couple of hours before that.</p>

            <p>I was so sad when all this came to an end. I was so close to crying when it was time to say goodbye. I can't wait to see them again someday... I will be waiting to see you all! Soon, hopefully!</p>
