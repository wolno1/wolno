                <p>My name is Angel, also known as Wolno and ALSO known as @AwsArtzzz (Trust me, I didn't even think about that last one, and @Wolno was already taken on Twitter)</p>
                <p>I'm an artist, as you might know, a furry artist to be specific; drawing furries brings my life some kind of joy I would not be able to describe. Despite being just a hobby, I think art is a huge part of my life.</p>
                <p>My current art projects include a comic I'll be posting here, and I'm trading adopts (If interested, check out my <a href="https://toyhou.se/Wolno/characters/folder:4872509" style="color: #ff00f8;">Toyhouse</a>!).</p>
                <p>This page is also my other project (If it counts as an art project), and that is where my life will be depending on soon: programming!</p>

                <p>I'm currently going for a software technology major; I'd say it's one of my talents! Since the moment I tried programming in high school, I knew this was for me. After being a dropout of medicine (Don't ask me why I signed up for that, I'm ashamed), I decided to start studying programming!</p>
                <p>This would probably go on my curriculum, so yeah, if you, Mr. HR, see this, I really hope you consider me for the job; I'm quite desperate.</p>
